      <description>One to edit all A large portion of a programmer&amp;rsquo;s everyday work is to manipulate text and knowing how to do this effortlessly can enhance his/her efficiency at coding. The best way, in my opinion, to be proficient with an editor is to pick one, which ever one you want, and use it every day to edit just anything and in genaral stick with it. Occasionally tweak it a little, try to cut down the number of keystrokes you need to type for a specific task and think about what can be improved in your workflow.</description>
