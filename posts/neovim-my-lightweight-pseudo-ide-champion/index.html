<h2 id="one-to-edit-all">One to edit all</h2>

<p>A large portion of a programmer&rsquo;s everyday work is to manipulate text and
knowing how to do this effortlessly can enhance his/her efficiency at coding.
The best way, in my opinion, to be proficient with an editor is to pick one,
which ever one you want, and use it every day to edit just anything and in
genaral stick with it. Occasionally tweak it a little, try to cut down the
number of keystrokes you need to type for a specific task and think about what
can be improved in your workflow.</p>

<p>I remember when the senior who was responsible for me, told me at my very first
day at work that was ok to spend a couple of days to setup my editor, as all
this initial lost time would be amortized in the long run. He was using emacs so
I selected Vim, more specifically Neovim, for obvious reasons. ðŸ˜„</p>

<h3 id="the-path-to-the-glory">The path to the glory</h3>

<p>At the beginning was somewhat cumbersome to edit everything with Nvim as our
codebase was big and complex but I stuck with my plan and this little everyday
habit increased my productivity over time. Till now Nvim is my sole editor and
is the first program that I fire up every day. It has been converted into a
lightweight IDE as I will describe bellow and I am happy seeing my editing
skills progressing alongside with the programming ones. By the way <a href="https://github.com/kalexio/dotfiles">init.vim</a>
of this repo is my Nvim configuration.</p>

<h2 id="traits-of-a-lighweight-champion">Traits of a Lighweight Champion</h2>

<p>Nvim which is heavily based on Vim is a very powerful editor but in order to be
used efficiently in large codebases one has to configure it.
I wanted to keep my
configuration as simple as possible and also not to be relied upon a myriad of
plugins in order to not disrupt the core mechanics of the editor and to be
almost equal efficient when confronted with a plain Vim/Nvim in another machine.
Also I try to use plugins that are <a href="http://vimcasts.org/blog/2012/08/on-sharpening-the-saw/"><em>sharpening the saw</em></a> as drew neil says and
which fit the Vim philosophy well. All of them are separated into the below
categories:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Eyecandy:</strong> I use <a href="https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox">gruvbox</a> for a nice
colorscheme and <a href="https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim">lightline.vim</a> for a
light and configurable statusline/tabline. Nothing special here.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Utilities:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/bronson/vim-trailing-whitespace">vim-trailing-whitespace</a>
anotates trailing spaces and creates a new command &ldquo;<em>:FixWhitespace</em>&rdquo; for
instant cleaning of them and <a href="https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter">vim-gitgutter</a>
which operates like a git diff and shows a quick preview of your changes on the
file you are editing. Well, nothing special again, you can live happily without
them.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Project-wide search:</strong> The plugins of this category are the most important ones.
They enhance my workflow and convert Nvim to a lightweigth
IDE. These plugins are related to how quickly you can find a specific symbol
(function, parameter etc) or getting familiar with large codebases. More
specifically, I use <a href="https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar">tagbar</a> which provides
an easy way to browse the tags of the current file and get an overview of its
structure (super useful when opening a file for first
time!) and <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-vinegar">vim-vinegar</a>.
Split windows and the project drawer go together like oil and vinegar
(<a href="http://vimcasts.org/blog/2013/01/oil-and-vinegar-split-windows-and-project-drawer/">an eye opener article for my workflow</a>).
So  instead of using project
drawer plugins like the famous NerdTree I prefer using a less well-known built
in file explorer for Nvim called netrw vinegar just enhances the built in file
explorer. That way I can be productive also in stock Vim/Nvim.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Also for project-wide searching I use two external tools, <a href="http://ctags.sourceforge.net/">ctags</a> and
<a href="http://cscope.sourceforge.net/">cscope</a>.
Ctags is used for jumping from function calls to their definitions while cscope tool
adds the ability to jump to any of the places where a function is
called. Usually I run the <strong>cscope_gen.sh</strong>  script (see below the shell commands) to create a file which contains
the filenames of all the files of the project that I am working on.
This file is  later fed on cscope and ctags to create the cscope database and tags file
respectively.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">find /path/to/source/code/root/directory -path /path/to/folder/for/exclusion -prune -o -print | egrep -i &quot;\.(c|h|cpp|hpp)$&quot; &gt; cscope.files
cscope -b -q
ctags -L cscope.files
</code></pre>

<p>This way I am only a g] or CTRL-] keystrokes away from jumping to
the place where that method is defined or implemented and  with the command
&ldquo;<em>:cs find e &ldquo;C symbol&rdquo;</em>&rdquo; I can find the C symbol everywhere in the project.
Both of them are extremely fast
because they work on prebuilt indexes to search for the required C symbol. Of
course sometimes I use the very well known and beloved tool grep.</p>

<p>Dead simple right? This is of course under constant work in progress and I
recommend everyone to check <a href="http://vimcasts.org/">drew neil&rsquo;s vimcasts</a> as they
contain a lot of high quality information. Last but not least, this is how my configured Nvim
currenlty looks like!</p>
